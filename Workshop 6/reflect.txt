=> In this workshop i learned about the STL containers , as well as refreshed my knowledge about polymorphic objects.
In other words I became familiar with storing and managing polymorphic objects with the implementation of STL vector.
While I was working on my workshop I had a little difficulty with the storage and management of polymorphic objects in STL 
vector containers, but after refering to external resources and reading course material I have figured out how to solve that 
issue.
