Reflection on Workshop 7 :

=> In this workshop , I learned how to insert the data into the sequential containers , moreover 
I became familiar with using the mathematical functions from the specific libraries to perform 
the calculations . In addition to that , I refreshed my knowledge about the lambda expressions.
On the other hand , I became known with the algorithm library in depth and learned how to use functions
from the algorithm library.
