=> In this workshop I learned and practiced how to use Lambda expressions to return a value for the requested operators.
In addition to that , I refreshed my knowledge about handling errors by practicing the commands like try, throw and catch. 
Moreover, I also learned how to assign values and data which is read from the file to the object of the class.
On the other hand , I prevented the copying , moving and assigning of an object in this assignment.
