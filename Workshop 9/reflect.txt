Reflection to Workshop 9:
=> At the end of this workshop , I became familiar with how to write data to a file and read data from a file in a binary mode. Moreover, 
I learned the concept of joining function to its arguments. On the other hand , I saw in practice how we can use threads for multi-tasking.
