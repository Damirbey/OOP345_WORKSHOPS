Reflection for the Workshop 4

=> In this particular workshop I learned about the concept of composition of objects.
In other words , I became familiar with how to include the objects of other classes in the new classes . 
In addition to that , I refreshed my knowledge about the move operators and move assignment operators.
Moreover , by completing this workshop I learned about the parsing strings  and storing them in the objects of other classes 
which are read from the data files.
